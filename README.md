# About the repository: 
This hypothetical tool efficiently ensures that your password is hard to guess.

The requirements for the password are:
- At least ten characters long
- At least two uppercase letters
- At least two lowercase letters
- At least two digits
- At least two special characters.

To ensure further security, an additional requirement mandates that the password must be different than your five previous passwords. This hypothetical tool lets you know if the password is strong enough. 

## How to run the code:
1. Compile by opening terminal or cmd:
```bash
g++ main.cpp PasswordCheck.cpp -o PasswordCheck.exe
```
2. Run

- (linux)
  ```bash
  ./PasswordCheck
  ```
- (windows)
  ```bash
  PasswordCheck.exe
  ```
